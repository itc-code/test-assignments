> ## Github repository browsing tool
> This task looks like a average task you will receive from us. But it's scope is bigger than usual, since we want to see as much skills as possible.
>
> ### Subject
> We need to create a third-party service to list user's Github repositories.
>
> So, the process is:
>
> 1. You log in to Github
> 2. You log in to our service with Github account
> 3. It shows a list of all your repositories, your avatar, and username on the same page
>
> ### Extra
> We also want to know the author of this service. Please, provide a link to the source code on the bottom of the page in a form of: `Created by <link-to-your-account>, source code: <link-to-the-github-repo>.`
>
> ### Technologies
> Fill free to use any tools you like (minding the license). But, note that you are limited to the platform. If you are applying to `python` position it would be very strange to submit a `js` solution.
>
> ### Result
> This should be 100% working and deployed service. You should provide a live link for us to browse it.
>
> ### Time
> Time estimated: from 2 to 3 hours If it takes more than that, well, I guess you are doing something wrong.
>
> ### Process
> That's how we work internally, maybe it would be helpful: http://wemake.services/meta/employees
